- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Thomas, 29 y/o, coming from France, and current living in the Netherlands.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the application of Artifical Intelligence in the fields of aeropace, healthcare, automotive or ecology. 
- After studying aerospace engineering and system engineering in Toulouse, France, I joined the ArianeGroup company in Paris, France, where I worked for 2.5 years as system engineer on the future space launcher Ariane 6. Looking for new challenges abroad, I then moved to Thales Netherlands as responsible for deploying Model-Based System Engineering.
- After reading those lines you may wonder how these professional activities are related to AI / ML. Well... there is none... Curious by nature, I wanted to know more about Artificial Intelligence, and thus decided to follow the online course "Machine Learning", offered by Standford University on Coursera. I found myself passionate by it and continued my journey into this field, completely new to me. It has been 3 years now that I am studying Artifical Antelligence on my free time.
- Now that I finally (and successfully!) completed 2 onlines micro-masters (one in Software Engineering and another in Artifical Intelligence, by Columbia University on Edx). Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on diverse projects with passionate colleagues keen to share and learned from each others.
