- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThomasLeMontagner, from France, living in the Netherlands.
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of artifical intelligence in the fields of aeropace, healthcare and ecology. My educational background is system engineering, and I am working as model-based system engineering at Thales Netherlands in the naval industry, after 3 years at ArianeGroup working on the space launcher Ariane 6.
- 🌱 I consider myself a novice software engineer even though, in parallel of my job, I am studying hard since a couple of years in order to take a turn in my professional career. 
- 💞️ Now that I finally (and successfully!) completed 2 onlines micro-masters (one in Software Engineering and another in Artifical Intelligence) I’m looking to collaborate on diverse projects with passionate people keen to share and learned from each others.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by email: thomas.le-montagner@hotmail.com or on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-le-montagner/
